# PotterData
This is a data store for some data that I have been working with.

I only used a subset of characters from the Harry Potter books.  The relationships are *not* symmetric, e.g. Sirius Black likes his brother Regulus, but Regulus dislikes Sirius.  Positive scores mean a positive relationship, negative scores mean a negative relationship.

I tried to stick to the following scale:

1 - Acquaintances / Rivals

2 - Friends / Enemies

3 - Allies / Violent Hatred

4 - Family / Sworn Enemy

5 - Father-Son / Close Betrayal
